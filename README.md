# Binary_Heap_Tree
Written in HTML and JavaScript, this prototype was created during a research fellowship at the University of Iowa. It is an auditory, keyboard-accessible website for blind users to explore a binary tree and learn about the binary heap sort algorithm.

This prototype is an implementation of an example where a node 80 is inserted into a tree with existing nodes 40, 30, 60, 10, and 20. Based on the binary heap sort algorithm, node 80 is placed in the tree.

To best experience this prototype, click on the website link and use a screen reader (i.e. VoiceOver, NVDA, or JAWS) to explore the tree. If you want to see a visual representation of the prototype, visit https://visualgo.net/en/heap and create a tree with these values: 40, 30, 60, 10, 20. After that, insert another value 80, which will be sorted and prioritized within the tree.
